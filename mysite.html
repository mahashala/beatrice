        <h2>1. Tropospheric NO₂, Meteorology, and Seasonal Variability over Ghana Using TROPOMI</h2>
        <p>
            This study analyzed spatial and seasonal NO₂ concentration patterns across Ghana using TROPOMI satellite data. 
            The research examined relationships between NO₂ hotspots and meteorological fields such as wind speed, boundary 
            layer height, temperature, and convection. The project identified key seasonal contrasts between the dry and wet 
            seasons and highlighted pollution signatures over Accra, Kumasi, and industrial zones.
        </p>

        <h2>2. SEIR Modeling of Tuberculosis (TB) in the Savannah Region of Ghana</h2>
        <p>
            This project incorporated meteorological variables into the classic SEIR epidemiological model to investigate how 
            temperature, humidity, and rainfall influence TB incidence. The study performed temporal correlation analysis, trend 
            assessment, and parameter sensitivity evaluation to understand climate–health dynamics.
        </p>

        <h2>3. SEIR Modeling of Typhoid Transmission</h2>
        <p>
            A mathematical modeling framework exploring disease transmission dynamics under varying environmental conditions. 
            The model provided insight into exposure, infection cycle, and recovery processes as influenced by environmental 
            stressors.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Greenhouse Gas Assessment over Farmland</h2>
        <p>
            A mini research project evaluating atmospheric greenhouse gas loading over agricultural environments. The study 
            focused on anthropogenic versus natural emission contributors and their meteorological modulation.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Tropical Weather Systems Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Developed a comprehensive set of 200-question MCQs from MET452 (Prediction of Tropical Weather Systems) to evaluate 
            student understanding of West African monsoon dynamics, easterly waves, tropical cyclones, and convective weather 
            processes.
