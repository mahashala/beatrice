        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am <strong>Mahashala Michael Oppong</strong>, an Atmospheric Scientist and Climate Researcher with a strong interest in 
            atmospheric composition, meteorology–pollution interactions, and climate-health linkages. I hold a degree in 
            Meteorology and Climate Science from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST).
        </p>

        <p>
            My academic and research work spans atmospheric NO₂ mapping, tropospheric dynamics, SEIR modeling for infectious 
            diseases, tropical meteorology, environmental management, and the analysis of satellite-derived datasets such as 
            TROPOMI. I employ Python, R, GIS, and quantitative analytics to interpret climate and environmental data and extract 
            meaningful insights for policy, public health, and environmental decision-making.
        </p>

        <p>
            I served as <strong>President of the Meteorology and Climate Science Students Association (MCSAK)</strong>, where I led 
            climate awareness campaigns, outreach to senior high schools in Kumasi, and capacity-building events for students. 
            My portfolio also includes entrepreneurship (founder of <strong>Shala_Trades</strong>), science communication, digital media 
            design, and youth empowerment content creation.
        </p>

        <p>
            My long-term mission is to contribute innovative climate solutions through research, modeling, and scientific 
            communication — bridging the gap between science, policy, and community impact.
